== Tic Tac Toe ==

Kindergarten implementation of tictactoe in python

# representation 
state is 9 zeros + 1 zero which tells who is making turn

because `0` looks like `o` or `O` i'll represent O's as -1 and X's as 1, 0 means empty square

# move input
should taken move be `a1` in context of board that is `c` characters on 3 characters long?

or 

inputs in range 0-8

    1   2   3

a  a1, a2, a3

b  b1, b2, b3

c  c1, c2, c3

by enumerating this we can get this

[(0, 'a1'), (1, 'a2'), (2, 'a3'), (3, 'b1'), (4, 'b2'), (5, 'b3'), (6, 'c1'), (7, 'c2'), (8, 'c3')]

== Testing ==

if testing run `python3 -m pytest -v` from home directory, otherwise won't work.

== todo == 

* check for wins in rows
* check for wins in diagonals
* check for draws
* wiret test for both of those things
